# **6️⃣ Lifecycle Management**

**Kid Explanation:**

* Imagine a book goes through stages in the library:

  1. **Draft** → just arrived, not checked yet
  2. **Published** → ready for kids to read
  3. **Gold Star** → certified as perfect book
  4. **Deprecated** → old or damaged, no longer used

**Pro Explanation:**

* Collibra Asset Lifecycle = **managing the status of datasets, reports, or glossary terms**.
* Common Stages:

  * **Draft** → created but not certified
  * **Published** → visible to users, but not certified
  * **Certified** → verified by stewards, trusted for use
  * **Deprecated** → outdated, should not be used
* Helps:

  * Maintain data governance
  * Ensure only certified datasets are used
  * Track progress from creation → approval → retirement

**Real-time / Interview Tip:**

* Interviewers may ask:

  * “How do you ensure only trusted datasets are used?”
  * “How do you manage the lifecycle of critical datasets?”
* Strong Answer:
  *"We implemented asset lifecycle management in Collibra. All new datasets started as Draft, were reviewed by stewards, certified if high quality, and deprecated when outdated. This reduced errors from using untrusted datasets by 35%."*

# **7️⃣ Business & Technical Metadata Linking**

**Kid Explanation:**

* Imagine the library has:

  * **Story names** (business words) → “The Adventure of Alice”
  * **Book codes** (technical labels) → BK001, BK002

**Pro Explanation:**

* Business & Technical Metadata Linking = **connecting business glossary terms to technical datasets**.
* Purpose:

  * Ensure **business understands the data**
  * Align **IT and business definitions**
  * Help analytics and reporting teams use the right datasets
* Example:

  * Glossary term “Customer” → linked to **Customer_Master table in Snowflake** → linked to **Sales dashboards in Tableau**

**Real-time / Interview Tip:**

* Interviewers may ask:

  * “How do you ensure business users understand technical datasets?”
  * “How do you link glossary terms to tables?”
* Strong Answer:
  *"We linked business glossary terms to technical datasets in Snowflake. For example, the term 'Customer' was linked to the Customer_Master table and relevant Tableau dashboards, ensuring consistency in reporting across business and IT teams."*
