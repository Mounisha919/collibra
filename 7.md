Perfect 👍 let’s now go **deep into Collibra Connectors** — from **kid-level** story to **real-world enterprise use**, with **architecture, configuration flow, examples, and interview focus**.

# **1️⃣ Collibra Connectors (Detailed Explanation)**

---

## 🧸 **Kid Explanation:**

Imagine your library wants to know about **every other library in the city**.
You can’t go and note down every book manually — that would take forever! 😩

So, the library uses **magic trucks** 🚚 that automatically visit other libraries, collect information about the books (titles, authors, topics), and bring them back.
Now your library always knows what’s in every other library — *automatically updated!*

That’s what **Collibra Connectors** do — they automatically bring in information (metadata) from different systems into Collibra.

---

## 💼 **Pro Explanation:**

### 🔹 What Are Collibra Connectors?

Collibra **Connectors** are **integration bridges** that help pull in metadata (and sometimes lineage) automatically from **external systems** into **Collibra Data Catalog**.

They form the **foundation** for automating **metadata ingestion**, **lineage building**, and **data catalog population**.

---

## ⚙️ **Connector Architecture**

```
Source System (DB / ETL / BI / Cloud)
        ↓
  Collibra Connector (Crawler / Adapter)
        ↓
 Collibra Data Governance Center (DGC)
        ↓
   Assets, Lineage, Policies, Glossary
```

### Example:

* Source: Snowflake → Connector → Collibra
* Metadata pulled: Tables, columns, schemas, owners, descriptions
* Lineage pulled: ETL jobs, transformations, mappings
* Result: Automatically created “Assets” in Collibra Catalog

---

## 🔹 **Types of Collibra Connectors**

### 1️⃣ **Out-of-the-Box (OOB) Connectors**

Provided by Collibra itself or the Collibra Marketplace.

Examples:

| Category               | Tool                                      | What It Does                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Databases              | Snowflake, Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL | Extracts metadata (schemas, tables, columns, constraints)    |
| ETL / Data Integration | Informatica, Talend, AWS Glue             | Extracts data flow logic, builds lineage                     |
| BI Tools               | Tableau, Power BI, Qlik, Looker           | Brings in reports, dashboards, and their data source mapping |
| Cloud Storage          | AWS S3, GCS, Azure Blob                   | Catalogs bucket, folder, and file metadata                   |
| Data Quality           | Collibra DQ, Great Expectations           | Syncs quality rules, scores, and violations                  |
| API / Event Connectors | Collibra REST APIs, Kafka                 | For custom integration and real-time sync                    |

---

### 2️⃣ **Custom Connectors (via Collibra Connect)**

* Built using **MuleSoft (Collibra Connect)** or **Collibra API**.
* Used when a system is **not supported out-of-the-box** (e.g., internal DB, custom tool).
* You define how metadata should be extracted → transformed → uploaded.
* Uses **REST API, JDBC, or file-based** ingestion.

**Example:**

> Built a custom connector using MuleSoft to integrate a legacy Oracle Data Warehouse with Collibra. It extracted schema and table details daily and updated the catalog.

---

## 🔹 **Connector Components (Under the Hood)**

Each connector has 3 key layers:

| Layer                  | Description                                       | Example                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Metadata Extractor** | Reads metadata from source (DB, ETL, BI)          | Extracts schema, tables, lineage         |
| **Transformer**        | Maps extracted metadata to Collibra’s asset model | Maps DB table → Collibra “Table Asset”   |
| **Publisher / Loader** | Pushes metadata into Collibra via REST API        | Creates or updates assets, lineage links |

---

## 🔹 **Configuration & Deployment**

1. **Download the connector package** from **Collibra Marketplace**
2. **Install and configure** connection details:

   * Hostname / DB name
   * Credentials (service account)
   * Connector runtime (on-prem or cloud)
3. **Schedule ingestion**

   * Daily / weekly metadata sync
4. **Validate results**

   * Check imported assets in Catalog
   * Verify lineage in Lineage View
5. **Monitor connector runs**

   * Using Collibra Console or Scheduler logs

---

## 💡 **Real-time Enterprise Example**

> In our organization, we connected **Snowflake**, **Tableau**, and **Informatica** to Collibra using prebuilt connectors.
>
> * The **Snowflake connector** brought in schema, tables, and column metadata.
> * The **Informatica connector** extracted ETL workflows for lineage.
> * The **Tableau connector** added reports and dashboards linked to data sources.
>   As a result, Collibra showed **complete lineage** from source → transformation → visualization, helping auditors trace data easily.

## 📊 **Benefits of Using Connectors**

✅ Eliminates manual metadata entry
✅ Keeps the data catalog always current
✅ Enables end-to-end **data lineage visibility**
✅ Improves **trust and governance automation**
✅ Reduces audit preparation time significantly
