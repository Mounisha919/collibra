# üß∏ Topic 10: Real-life Scenarios & STAR Stories (Kid Story Expanded)

Back to the **library analogy** üìö:

* A new kid asks: ‚ÄúWhich books can I trust? Who checks them? Where did they come from?‚Äù
* You tell a **story of the library workflow**:

  1. **Source ‚Üí Library** = Lineage: Shows origin of the book (Publisher ‚Üí Room ‚Üí Shelf)
  2. **Stewards** = Librarians who check books and mark them safe
  3. **Trusted books** = Gold stars = Certification
  4. **Secret books** = PII tagged, restricted to authorized readers
  5. **Dictionary / Glossary** = Avoids confusion between similar books

**Kid takeaway:** Instead of giving definitions, you **explain the full story**, showing you understand the process end-to-end.
