# 🧸 Topic 10: Real-life Scenarios & STAR Stories (Kid Story)

Imagine you’re showing the library to a new kid 📚:

* The kid asks: “Which books are safe? Who looks after them? Where did they come from?”
* You tell a **story of how the library works**:

  1. **Source** = Publisher → Library (Lineage)
  2. **Stewards** = Librarians who check books
  3. **Trusted books** = Gold stars (Certification)
  4. **Secret books** = PII tagged
  5. **Dictionary** = Glossary to avoid confusion

**Kid takeaway:** You explain the **process through a story**, not just definitions — that’s how interviewers like it.
