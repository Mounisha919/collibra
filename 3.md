# üß∏ Topic 7: Data Quality & Certification (Kid Story)

Back to our library again üìö:

* Some books are **perfect** ‚Äî no missing pages, clear print, correct labels ‚Üí we **trust** them.
* Some are **damaged** ‚Äî torn pages, missing content, wrong title ‚Üí we **don‚Äôt trust** them.

So, what does the librarian do?

* Checks every book carefully.
* Gives a **gold star** ‚≠ê to books that are perfect.
* Sends the damaged ones for repair or removes them from shelves.

In data terms:

* **Data Quality** = Checking if the data is **correct, complete, and reliable**.
* **Certification** = Giving a **trusted badge** ‚úÖ to high-quality datasets.

**Kid takeaway:**
Only gold-starred books are safe for homework; bad ones are fixed or set aside.
Likewise, only certified datasets are safe for analysis and reporting.

# üè¢ Topic 7: Data Quality & Certification (Pro Explanation)

Data quality is the **heart of Data Governance** ‚Äî it ensures that data is **fit for purpose**, while certification formalizes **trust** in that data.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is Data Quality in Collibra?

**Data Quality (DQ)** refers to the **measurement and monitoring** of data accuracy, completeness, and reliability across systems.

### üîπ Key Dimensions

| Dimension                  | Description                          | Example                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Accuracy**               | Data should reflect real-world facts | Customer DOB matches ID proof                            |
| **Completeness**           | No missing or null values            | All invoices have customer IDs                           |
| **Consistency**            | Uniform data across systems          | ‚ÄúM‚Äù and ‚ÄúMale‚Äù standardized                              |
| **Uniqueness**             | No duplicates                        | Customer record appears once                             |
| **Timeliness / Freshness** | Data updated at expected frequency   | Sales data refreshed daily                               |
| **Validity / Integrity**   | Follows business & format rules      | Email pattern: [name@domain.com](mailto:name@domain.com) |

Collibra can integrate with **data quality engines** (like Collibra DQ, Informatica, or Talend) to automatically compute these metrics and store them as **DQ scores** or **rules** inside the catalog.

# üß∏ Topic 8: Integration with Data Sources (Kid Story Expanded)

Imagine the **library analogy**, now with more details:

* You have **bookshelves in different rooms**, each representing a type of data source:

  * **Room 1:** Oracle Database ‚Üí old library room with lots of paper books.
  * **Room 2:** Snowflake ‚Üí modern digital library.
  * **Room 3:** Tableau Dashboards ‚Üí interactive screens showing summary info.
  * **Room 4:** Files in S3 / GCS ‚Üí boxes of loose sheets.
  * **Room 5:** ETL tools (Informatica, Talend, Spark) ‚Üí conveyor belts moving books and adding notes.

* The **library wants one central catalog** of all books.

* How do they do it?

  1. They send **trucks (connectors/agents)** to every room to **read book labels (metadata)**.
  2. The trucks collect info about:

     * **Books** ‚Üí Tables
     * **Chapters** ‚Üí Columns
     * **Owners** ‚Üí Data owners/stewards
     * **Updates** ‚Üí Changes in data, new tables, new dashboards
  3. Some rooms are **automatic** (digital) ‚Üí info comes instantly.
     Some rooms are **manual** ‚Üí librarians must update labels.
  4. Once all info is collected, **the library catalog is complete**, and librarians can **mark trusted books** (certification).

**Kid takeaway:** Integration = sending trucks to gather info from every room to build a **complete, trusted library catalog**.
