Nice — I’ll double down: first **kid-friendly** analogies so it’s super easy to remember, then **exact, step-by-step real-time actions** you’d do when integrating a data source into Collibra (so you can answer like a 5-yr experienced data governance pro). I’ll finish with **interview-ready lines** you can use and a short troubleshooting checklist.

# 🧸 Kid-style story (one quick picture in your head)

Imagine your school library getting a new set of storybooks.

1. You (the librarian) collect the boxes (that’s the **data source**).
2. You open each book and read the cover to know the title, author, number of pages (that’s **metadata** — data *about* the book).
3. You put a sticker with the genre, and link the book to a topic list (that’s **business glossary mapping**).
4. You draw arrows on a map to show where the book came from (publisher) and where it will be used (story hour) — that’s **lineage**.
5. You tag who is responsible for the book (Ms. Priya, librarian) — that’s **stewardship**.

Integrating a data source into Collibra is exactly the librarian’s job — but with databases, cloud warehouses, and reports instead of storybooks.

# # Real-time step-by-step: what you actually DO when integrating a data source into Collibra

Below each step: first a **kid-friendly line**, then the **real technical action** you’d perform.

### 1) Decide the “how” — pick the right connector (Which truck to use?)

Kid: “Which truck can carry these boxes?”
Pro action: Choose the ingestion method — Collibra Catalog connectors (Edge/JDBC/JobServer), REST API ingestion, or a third-party connector/ETL (Fivetran, Portable, custom scripts). Collibra supports many connectors via its Edge / Catalog connector framework. ([productresources.collibra.com][1])

### 2) Prepare access & security (Make sure the truck can enter the school gate)

Kid: “Get permission and the key to open the gate.”
Pro action: Get hostname, port, service account or user credentials, network/VPN rules, firewall exceptions, and any proxy/VPC peering. Validate least-privilege credentials that can read metadata (and sample data if required). Document secrets in a secure store (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) — don’t paste creds in chat.

### 3) Install / configure the connector (Park the truck and connect the ramp)

Kid: “Connect the ramp so boxes can roll in.”
Pro action:

* If using Collibra Edge or JobServer, install/prepare the Edge host in your environment and ensure it can reach the source.
* Create a new connection in Collibra (choose JDBC, Snowflake connector etc.), upload or point to the correct JDBC driver if required, test connectivity, and tune sampling options. (Collibra docs show connector/Edge usage and JDBC connections.) ([productresources.collibra.com][1])

> ⚠️ Note: Collibra Connect (older integration product) has been deprecated — make sure you use the supported integration pattern for your Collibra version. ([developer.collibra.com][2])

### 4) Initial harvest / metadata ingestion (Open each book and read the cover)

Kid: “Take each book, read title/author/page count.”
Pro action: Run the first metadata scan / harvest. The connector will import assets: systems → databases → schemas → tables/views → columns and technical properties (types, nullability, row counts if supported). Review imported assets in Collibra and fix mapping mismatches.

### 5) Map technical metadata to Collibra asset model (Put labels where they belong)

Kid: “Put the right sticker (adventure, fairy tale) on each book.”
Pro action: Map source objects to Collibra asset types. Configure how source metadata fields map to Collibra attributes (e.g., source `last_altered` → Collibra `lastModified`). Optionally import sample row data (for profiling) if allowed.

### 6) Link to Business Glossary & assign stewards (Who owns the book?)

Kid: “Attach a note: ‘Ask Ms. Priya if torn page’.”
Pro action: Link imported technical assets to business terms (Customer, Order, etc.), assign data owners and stewards, and create stewardship workflows so owners get notifications for certification or issues.

### 7) Capture lineage (Draw arrows from publisher → truck → library shelf → story hour)

Kid: “Show where the book came from and where it’s read.”
Pro action: Integrate with ETL/ELT and BI tools (Informatica, Databricks/Unity Catalog, Tableau, etc.) so Collibra can automatically extract technical lineage; or use lineage ingestion APIs or partner tools to push lineage. Collibra Data Lineage provides end-to-end lineage (technical + business) for supported sources. ([productresources.collibra.com][3])

Also check the supported lineage sources to ensure automatic extraction is available for your toolset. ([productresources.collibra.com][4])

### 8) Enrich with profiling & data quality (Check if pages are torn or missing)

Kid: “Look inside to see if pages are missing or messy.”
Pro action: Connect your data profiling / quality tools (Collibra Data Quality, third-party checks, or scheduled SQL probes) to populate quality metrics (null %, duplicates, freshness). Surface these metrics in Collibra and drive certification decisions.

### 9) Apply policies & PII tagging (Mark the pages that cannot be read by everyone)

Kid: “Put a red sticker on secret books.”
Pro action: Tag sensitive elements (PII: SSN, Email), attach access policies and masking rules or link to access request workflows. Document where sensitive data exists and who can see it.

### 10) Schedule refreshes & monitor (Check the library every morning)

Kid: “Decide when to check the shelves again.”
Pro action: Schedule periodic scans (daily/hourly) for metadata and lineage changes. Monitor ingestion jobs, set alerts for failures, and log changes for auditing.

### 11) Certify datasets & operationalize (Award the ‘trusted’ gold star)

Kid: “Put a gold star on the best books so kids know they’re good.”
Pro action: Use certification workflows — stewards review quality/lineage and certify the dataset as trusted. Deprecated/duplicate datasets are labelled and marked so users pick the certified one.

# 🔬 Real example: Integrating Snowflake into Collibra (quick, concrete)

Kid: “We get books from the Snowflake warehouse box.”
Pro action (real steps):

1. Create a Snowflake read-only service account and give it usage on the schemas/tables you want indexed.
2. In Collibra, create a Snowflake connector/Edge JDBC connection, provide account, role, warehouse, and test. (There’s a Snowflake-Collibra quickstart guide that walks through cataloging Snowflake data into Collibra.) ([Snowflake Quickstarts][5])
3. Run initial metadata harvest to import databases → schemas → tables → columns.
4. Pull lineage from Snowflake Unity Catalog or from your ETL processes (if supported). Collibra can capture technical lineage for supported sources. ([productresources.collibra.com][4])
5. Map tables to business terms, add stewards, run profiling, and certify stable datasets.

# 🛠 Troubleshooting checklist (fast)

* Connection failed: test JDBC from Edge host; check firewall, DNS, driver version.
* Permission denied: verify service account privileges and role.
* Missing tables/columns: check schema filters or excluded patterns in connector config.
* Lineage gaps: confirm your ETL/BI tool is supported and lineaged; if not, push lineage via API or use a partner tool. ([productresources.collibra.com][3])
* Slow harvests: reduce sampling, harvest only critical schemas, or run incremental scans.

# 🗣 Interview-ready answers you can say (short & confident)

**Q: “Walk me through how you integrate a new data source into Collibra.”**
Answer (example):
“First I gather requirements and owners, then provision a least-privilege service account and ensure network access. I create and test a connector (Edge/JDBC or cloud connector), perform an initial metadata harvest to import databases→tables→columns, then map assets to our business glossary, assign stewards, enable lineage capture for ETL/BI paths, add profiling/quality checks and schedule incremental scans. Finally I run a stewardship/certification workflow and monitor the connector for freshness. This turned a manual ‘ask-around’ process into an automated cataloged asset that business users can discover and trust.”

**Q: “How do you capture lineage?”**
Answer:
“Where possible I rely on automatic lineage extraction from the source or ETL tool (Collibra Data Lineage supports end-to-end technical and business lineage for many sources). For unsupported tools, I either ingest lineage via APIs or use partner tools to stitch lineage and push into Collibra. This gives us traceability from source to dashboard.” ([productresources.collibra.com][3])

# ✅ Quick summary (one-liner to memorize)

“To integrate a source: set up secure connectivity, use the appropriate Collibra connector or API to harvest metadata, map technical assets to business terms, capture lineage, enrich with quality/profiling, assign owners, certify trusted datasets, and schedule ongoing refreshes.”
