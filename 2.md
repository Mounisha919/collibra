Awesome! 🎉

Now let’s move to **Topic 4: Business Glossary** — this is **super important** for Collibra and interviews because it’s where **business and IT speak the same language**.

# 🧸 Topic 4: Business Glossary (Kid Story)

Imagine the library again 📚:

* Every kid calls things differently:

  * One kid says “Storybook”
  * Another says “Fiction Book”
  * Another says “Novel”

* Confusion! 🤯

So the **library creates a dictionary of terms**:

* “Storybook = Fiction Book = Novel”
* Now everyone knows exactly what it means.

In Collibra, this dictionary is called the **Business Glossary**.

It also helps:

* Link books (datasets) to terms
* Decide which books are “trusted”
* Give clear definitions so everyone understands

**Kid takeaway:** One dictionary, everyone uses the same words → no confusion.

# 🏢 Topic 4: Business Glossary (Pro Explanation)

**Business Glossary** in Collibra is a **central repository of business terms, definitions, and rules**.

### 1️⃣ Key Components

1. **Terms** – The word or phrase used in the business (e.g., “Customer”, “Order”).
2. **Definition / Description** – Explains exactly what the term means.
3. **Synonyms** – Alternate names used across teams.
4. **Steward / Owner** – Person responsible for maintaining the term.
5. **Relationships** – Links to datasets, reports, metrics, or other terms.
6. **Policies / Rules** – Business rules, compliance, or data usage restrictions.

---

### 2️⃣ Why It’s Important

* **Consistency:** Everyone interprets data the same way.
* **Clarity:** Reduces miscommunication between IT & business teams.
* **Traceability:** Each dataset is linked to glossary terms → easy to explain in audits.
* **Governance:** Policies can be applied at the term level, not just dataset level.

---

### 3️⃣ How It Works in Collibra

1. **Create terms** – For example, “Customer”, “Transaction”, “Revenue”.
2. **Add descriptions** – Make clear definitions.
3. **Link datasets** – Map columns or tables to terms.
4. **Assign stewards/owners** – They maintain the term and approve changes.
5. **Certification & policy enforcement** – Ensure linked datasets meet quality and compliance standards.

---

### 4️⃣ Example for Interviews

*"In our banking project, the term ‘Customer’ had multiple interpretations across Marketing, Sales, and Finance. We created a glossary term in Collibra, added a clear definition, linked all related datasets, assigned a steward, and certified the datasets. This reduced reporting errors by 25% and improved trust across teams."*

💡 **Kid → Pro Shortcut for Interviews:**

* Kid: “A dictionary for everyone in the library so all kids know what a book means.”
* Pro: “Business Glossary ensures consistent definitions of business terms, links them to datasets, assigns ownership, and enforces governance and compliance.”

---

Once you say **“I understand”**, we’ll move to **Topic 5: Stewardship & Ownership**, which explains **who takes care of data and why it matters** — very important for governance and real-time interview questions.

Do you understand Business Glossary?
Perfect! 🎉

Now we move to **Topic 5: Stewardship & Ownership** — this is crucial for Collibra because **data needs people responsible for it**, just like a library needs librarians.

---

# 🧸 Topic 5: Stewardship & Ownership (Kid Story)

Imagine the library again 📚:

* Books are everywhere. Some are **new**, some are **old**, some are **secret**.

* Who makes sure:

  * Books are in the right place?
  * Labels are correct?
  * Trusted books are gold-starred?

* That’s where **librarians (stewards/owners)** come in.

* **Owner:** The main person responsible for a book.

* **Steward:** Helps check the book, approves labels, fixes issues.

Every dataset in Collibra works the same way:

* Someone is **responsible** → ensures quality, compliance, and proper usage.
* If users have questions → they go to the steward.
* If a dataset is bad → steward fixes it or marks it deprecated.

**Kid takeaway:** Without librarians, the library would be messy. Without stewards, data is messy.

---

# 🏢 Topic 5: Stewardship & Ownership (Pro Explanation)

**Stewardship & Ownership** are core pillars of data governance in Collibra.

### 1️⃣ Roles

1. **Data Owner**

   * Ultimate responsibility for a dataset or glossary term.
   * Approves certification, access, policies, and changes.

2. **Data Steward**

   * Day-to-day management of datasets.
   * Ensures data quality, applies metadata, fixes errors.
   * Helps with lineage and compliance tagging.

3. **Collaborators / Analysts**

   * Use datasets, report issues, request access, but don’t have decision authority.

---

### 2️⃣ Why It’s Important

* **Accountability:** Every dataset has a responsible person.
* **Trust:** Users know who to ask if something seems wrong.
* **Quality & Compliance:** Stewards monitor metrics, lineage, PII, and governance rules.
* **Efficiency:** Reduces errors, duplicate datasets, and compliance risks.

---

### 3️⃣ How It Works in Collibra

1. Assign **Owner & Steward** when onboarding a dataset or glossary term.
2. Stewards review **metadata, lineage, quality scores, and glossary mapping**.
3. Stewards **approve certification** or deprecate datasets.
4. Owners enforce **policies, compliance, and access controls**.
5. Notifications & workflows automatically remind stewards of periodic reviews.

---

### 4️⃣ Example for Interviews

*"In a retail project, each dataset had a designated owner and steward. Owners approved datasets for certification, while stewards verified lineage and quality. When duplicate ‘Customer’ tables were found, stewards worked with the owner to certify one dataset as the source of truth and deprecate others. This improved trust and reduced mismatched reporting by 40%."*

---

💡 **Kid → Pro Shortcut for Interviews:**

* Kid: “Librarians make sure books are correct and in the right place.”
* Pro: “Data owners and stewards ensure datasets are trusted, compliant, and maintained, with clear accountability and workflows.”

Once you say **“I understand”**, we’ll move to **Topic 6: Data Lineage**, which explains **how to trace where data comes from and where it goes**, a key interview topic.

Do you understand Stewardship & Ownership?
Perfect! 🎉

Now let’s move to **Topic 6: Data Lineage** — this is **very important in Collibra and interviews** because it shows **where data comes from, how it moves, and where it’s used**.

---

# 🧸 Topic 6: Data Lineage (Kid Story)

Imagine the library again 📚:

* You have a **storybook** on the shelf.

* You want to know **where it came from**:

  * Publisher → Truck → Library → Shelf → Reading Desk

* That path is the **lineage** of the book.

In Collibra:

* Datasets move through systems (ETL → Warehouse → BI dashboards).
* Lineage tells us:

  * Source of data
  * Transformations applied
  * Where it’s finally used

**Kid takeaway:** Lineage = a treasure map for your data. You always know where it came from and where it goes.

---

# 🏢 Topic 6: Data Lineage (Pro Explanation)

**Data Lineage** is the visual representation and documentation of **data’s journey** from origin to destination.

### 1️⃣ Key Components

1. **Source System:** Where the data is created (Oracle, CSV, etc.)
2. **ETL / Transformation:** How data is processed (Informatica, Talend, Spark)
3. **Target System:** Where data lands (Data Warehouse, Snowflake, Tableau)
4. **Consumers / Dashboards:** Reports, analytics, or BI tools using the data
5. **Transformations:** Joins, aggregations, calculations

---

### 2️⃣ Why It’s Important

* **Trust:** Users know datasets are from reliable sources.
* **Impact Analysis:** If a source changes, you know which reports or dashboards are affected.
* **Compliance:** Shows where sensitive data flows → GDPR, PII, HIPAA.
* **Troubleshooting:** Quickly identify where errors or duplicates occur.

---

### 3️⃣ How Lineage Works in Collibra

1. **Automatic Capture:** Collibra connectors and ETL integration capture lineage automatically.
2. **Manual Mapping:** For legacy systems or manual processes.
3. **Visualization:** Lineage is displayed as a graph → source → transformation → target → dashboards.
4. **Certification & Governance:** Stewards verify lineage before certifying datasets.

---

### 4️⃣ Example for Interviews

*"In our banking project, the ‘Customer Master’ table lineage showed data from Oracle → Informatica ETL → Snowflake → Tableau dashboards. When a downstream report showed incorrect numbers, we traced the issue back to a transformation step. Lineage helped quickly fix the ETL job, reducing downtime and errors."*

---

💡 **Kid → Pro Shortcut for Interviews:**

* Kid: “A treasure map showing where the book came from and where it went.”
* Pro: “Data lineage visualizes data flow from source to target, showing transformations, systems, and consumers, enabling trust, impact analysis, and compliance.”

---

Once you say **“I understand”**, we’ll move to **Topic 7: Data Quality & Certification**, which explains **how to ensure data is trusted and reliable**, another hot interview topic.
