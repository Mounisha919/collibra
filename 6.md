# **🧸 Domains (Kid Story Version)**

Imagine the **library analogy** again 📚:

* The library has **different sections**:

  * Comics → Fun books for kids
  * Science → Textbooks, experiments
  * Fiction → Stories
  * Non-Fiction → Encyclopedias

* Each section has:

  * **Books** → datasets or dashboards
  * **Librarians** → stewards/owners
  * **Rules** → policies and approval workflows

* Why this matters:

  * You know exactly **where to find books**.
  * Only **authorized kids can access special sections**.
  * Librarians **manage and certify books**, so you know which are trustworthy.

**Kid takeaway:** Domains = library sections, organizing books, rules, and librarians so everything is easy to find and trusted.

---

# **🏢 Domains (Pro Explanation)**

**Domains in Collibra** are **logical groupings of assets, datasets, dashboards, reports, and glossary terms by business area**.

Think of **Domains as “buckets” that organize your enterprise data**.

---

## **1️⃣ Key Components of Domains**

1. **Assets**

   * All objects within the domain:

     * Tables, Views, Columns
     * Dashboards, Reports
     * Business Glossary Terms
     * Policies, Workflows

   * Assets are the **actual things you manage and govern**.

2. **Stewards & Owners**

   * **Data Owner:** Defines rules, approves workflows, responsible for dataset accuracy.
   * **Data Steward:** Implements governance, certifies datasets, reviews lineage, handles exceptions.
   * Together, they ensure **trust, compliance, and quality**.

3. **Policies & Workflows**

   * Each domain can have **custom governance policies**:

     * Certification rules → which datasets are trusted
     * Approval workflows → who must approve new assets
     * Access rules → RBAC for sensitive datasets

   * Example: Finance Domain → Every new financial report must be **certified by Finance Steward**.

4. **Hierarchy / Organization**

   * Domains can have **sub-domains**:

     * Customer Domain → Customer Master, Customer Transactions
     * Finance Domain → Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable
   * Makes **large organizations manageable**.

5. **Business Context**

   * Domains are **aligned with business areas**, not just IT.
   * Helps **business users find data they trust**.
   * Improves **data discoverability** and prevents duplication.

---

## **2️⃣ How Domains Work in Real Life / 5-Year Professional View**

1. **Grouping Assets**

   * Example: In a retail project:

     * **Sales Domain:** Sales Orders, Sales Transactions, Sales Dashboard, Glossary Term: “Total Sales”
     * **Customer Domain:** Customer Master, Customer Demographics, Customer Satisfaction Dashboard

2. **Stewardship & Governance**

   * Assign **stewards and owners per domain**.
   * Stewards **certify datasets, manage lineage, enforce data quality**.

3. **Policies and Workflows**

   * Example:

     * Sales Domain → Certification required before dashboard goes live
     * Finance Domain → Financial reports must pass approval workflow

4. **Integration with Collibra Features**

   * **Lineage:** Track how datasets in the domain flow to reports.
   * **Glossary mapping:** Link technical assets to business terms within the domain.
   * **Data Quality:** Monitor nulls, duplicates, or errors at the domain level.
   * **Compliance & PII:** Sensitive datasets within a domain are automatically tagged and access-controlled.

---

## **3️⃣ Interview STAR Example for Domains**

* **Situation:** In a retail project, multiple sales datasets were scattered across Oracle, Snowflake, and dashboards.
* **Task:** Organize datasets logically and ensure governance.
* **Action:**

  * Created **Sales Domain** in Collibra.
  * Assigned **Stewards and Owners** for all sales-related assets.
  * Linked **business glossary terms** like “Total Sales” and “Customer ID”.
  * Configured **certification workflows** and data quality rules.
* **Result:**

  * Reduced duplicate datasets by **30%**.
  * Improved discoverability and trust among analysts.
  * Auditors could easily review critical sales datasets.

---

## **4️⃣ Extra Details to Sound Like 5-Year Exp**

* **Domains vs Sub-Domains:**

  * Helps manage complex enterprises with **hundreds of datasets**.
  * Sub-domains inherit policies from parent but can have **custom rules**.

* **Domain Templates:**

  * Reusable templates for **similar business areas**, e.g., new departments or teams.

* **Cross-Domain Lineage:**

  * Domains may **interact**. Example: Sales Domain → Customer Domain → Marketing Domain.

* **Impact Analysis:**

  * When a dataset in a domain changes, **stewards know affected reports and dashboards**.

* **Metrics / Governance KPIs:**

  * % of certified datasets per domain
  * # of workflows completed
  * Number of approved vs rejected assets

* **Role Emphasis:**

  * Stewards & owners must **actively manage domain assets**, otherwise certification, compliance, and discoverability fail.

Each domain has assigned stewards and owners, policies and workflows, lineage tracking, certification, and data quality management to ensure discoverability, compliance, and governance.” |

---

✅ **Key Takeaway for Interview**

> Always mention **domains organize assets by business area, assign stewards/owners, enforce policies and workflows, enable certification and lineage, and improve discoverability and governance across the enterprise**. Use a **real-time STAR example** with metrics.

---
Perfect! Let’s dive into **Sub-Domains & Assets** in Collibra and explain it **like a 5-year professional**, covering **Kid version → Pro version → Components → Real-time examples → STAR interview points**, so you can answer **any follow-up question confidently**.

---

# **🧸 Sub-Domains & Assets (Kid Story Version)**

Imagine our library 📚 again:

* **Domains** = Library sections (Comics, Science, Fiction)
* **Sub-Domains** = Shelves inside those sections

  * Example: Science → Physics, Chemistry, Biology shelves
* **Assets** = The books on each shelf

  * Tables, dashboards, reports, glossary terms
* **Librarians** manage the shelf and books, check if they’re correct, and give gold stars for trusted books

**Kid takeaway:** Sub-domains are smaller sections within a domain, and assets are the actual items you manage. Librarians (stewards/owners) certify and protect them.

---

# **🏢 Sub-Domains & Assets (Pro Explanation)**

In **Collibra**:

* **Sub-Domains** = Logical subdivisions of a Domain for better organization and governance

  * Example:

    * Customer Domain → Customer Master, Customer Transactions, Customer Analytics
    * Finance Domain → Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, Payroll
* **Assets** = Actual objects under a domain or sub-domain

  * Datasets / Tables / Views
  * Dashboards / Reports
  * Business Glossary Terms
  * Policies / Workflows

**Why this matters:**

* Large organizations can have **hundreds or thousands of assets**. Sub-domains **avoid clutter** and improve discoverability.
* Assets are **the items you manage, govern, and certify**. Without organizing them properly, governance fails.

---

## **1️⃣ Key Components**

### a) Sub-Domains

* Hierarchical grouping under a Domain.
* Can inherit policies from parent Domain or have custom policies.
* Improves **navigation and governance**.
* Examples:

  * Finance Domain → Payroll Sub-Domain, Budgeting Sub-Domain
  * Sales Domain → Online Sales, Offline Sales

### b) Assets

* **Datasets / Tables** → Oracle, Snowflake, Redshift tables
* **Columns** → PII tagging, data type, constraints
* **Dashboards / Reports** → Tableau, PowerBI, Looker dashboards
* **Glossary Terms** → “Total Revenue,” “Customer ID,” “Order Date”
* **Policies / Workflows** → Certification rules, approvals, data quality checks

### c) Stewardship & Ownership

* **Domain Owner / Sub-Domain Owner:** Responsible for the entire sub-domain, policies, approvals
* **Steward:** Monitors asset quality, lineage, certification, compliance
* **Data Consumer:** Uses the assets, raises issues if needed

### d) Policies & Workflows

* **Certification workflow** → Approve datasets before they’re trusted
* **Access control** → RBAC for sensitive assets (PII, Finance data)
* **Data quality rules** → Null %, duplicates, outliers

### e) Lineage & Impact Analysis

* Assets under sub-domains can be traced for **source → transformation → target → report**
* Impact analysis ensures **changes to a table or dashboard are visible to all dependent assets**

---

## **2️⃣ Real-life / 5-Year Professional View**

1. **Organizing Assets**

* Retail project example:

  * Sales Domain → Online Sales Sub-Domain
  * Assets: Online Orders Table, Online Transactions Dashboard, Glossary Term “Online Revenue”
* Benefits: Analysts quickly find trusted datasets, dashboards, and definitions.

2. **Governance**

* Assign **sub-domain owners and stewards**
* Define workflows specific to sub-domain assets:

  * Example: Certification required for dashboards in Analytics Sub-Domain
* Policies can **override or inherit** from parent domain

3. **Lineage & Compliance**

* Track PII or financial data **at asset level**
* Sub-domain structure allows **fine-grained governance**

4. **Data Quality & Certification**

* Certify high-quality tables and dashboards
* Flag low-quality or untrusted assets
* Ensures **end-to-end trust** in the sub-domain

---

## **3️⃣ STAR Interview Example: Sub-Domains & Assets**

# 1️⃣ Marketplace

### Kid version

Marketplace = the library **store** where kids browse, request, and reuse ready-made books, tools, and workflows.

### Pro elevator pitch

**Collibra Marketplace** is a central hub for reusable assets — prebuilt connectors, governance workflows, templates, ingestion packages, and community-contributed items — that enables rapid, governed deployment of metadata ingestion, certification, PII tagging and other automation without reinventing the wheel.

### Key components & how it works (what to describe in interviews)

* **Catalog of assets:** templates for workflows (certification, remediation), connector packages, data classification rules, and UI components.
* **Connectors & Integration packages:** downloadable packages that include config, mapping rules, and sometimes Edge Agent settings for quick source onboarding.
* **Workflow templates:** prebuilt BPM/workflow definitions you can import and customize (approval chains, escalation).
* **Versioning & provenance:** each marketplace item should show version, publisher (internal / external), description, and change log.
* **Governance around marketplace items:** approvals for who can publish internal assets, review boards, and QA signoff before deployment.
* **Deployment flow:** browse → import/test in dev → configure for your environment → promote to prod → monitor and maintain.
* **Security & access control:** who can see, import, or publish assets; signed/verified packages for trusted items.
* **Community contributions & sharing:** internal teams share best practices; vendor-provided connectors speed up onboarding.

### How to explain integration/use step-by-step

1. Browse Marketplace and select connector/workflow template.
2. Import into a **development** Collibra environment.
3. Customize mappings, credentials (via secrets), schedules, and notifications.
4. Test ingestion/workflow end-to-end (sandbox data).
5. Run QA and security review (signing or approval).
6. Promote to production and schedule incremental scans.
7. Monitor runs, gather metrics, iterate.

### STAR Example (Marketplace)

**Situation:** Manual dataset certification and PII tagging took too long — each new source needed custom code.
**Task:** Reduce time to onboard new sources and apply governance.
**Action:** Used Collibra Marketplace connectors & workflow templates, imported and customized them, standardized mapping templates, introduced a QA signoff in dev. Promoted stable templates to production.
**Result:** Time to onboard a new data source dropped ~50%, certification throughput increased, fewer manual errors, and consistent PII tagging across sources.

### Interview talking points (say these to sound experienced)

* “We use Marketplace assets as the starting point — never copy/paste custom scripts; import templates and adapt them.”
* “Always test Marketplace connectors in a dev tenant, validate mapping, and sign off before production promotion.”
* “We maintain an internal ‘approved’ catalog and track version provenance so auditors can see what template was used and when.”
* “Marketplace enables governance by design: templates include approval steps and policy checks.”

### Common follow-up questions & one-line answers

* **Q: How do you secure Marketplace items?**
  A: Use RBAC on publishing, digital signing/versioning, QA review, and restrict imports to trusted users/environments.
* **Q: How do you handle customizations?**
  A: Keep a forked/internal copy; record diff/override metadata; keep upstream reference for updates.
* **Q: How do you test Marketplace connectors?**
  A: End-to-end tests with masked/synthetic data in dev, then smoke tests in pre-prod before promotion.

### Best practices & pitfalls to call out

* **Best:** Use templates to enforce consistent governance patterns (certification, PII detection). Add QA and security review into promotion pipelines. Version everything.
* **Pitfall:** Blindly importing vendor/community connectors without testing — may leak credentials, misclassify PII, or miss organization-specific fields.
* **Governance:** Maintain an internal “approved” category; require owners to sign-off on updates.

### KPIs / metrics to mention

* Time to onboard new data source (days → hours)
* % reduction in manual configuration effort (example: 50% reduction)
* # of reuseable templates & % adoption across teams
* Mean time to certify datasets using Marketplace workflows

# 2️⃣ Settings & Configuration

### Kid version

Settings = the **library rules**: who can borrow what, when the library is open, and which librarians manage which sections.

### Pro elevator pitch

**Collibra Settings & Configuration** is the system-level control plane that defines RBAC, connector endpoints, workflow behavior, notifications, policy enforcement, SSO/LDAP, audit logging, environment separation and operational parameters — everything needed to make Collibra secure, resilient, and aligned to enterprise governance practices.

### Key components & what to cover in an interview

* **Roles & Permissions / RBAC**

  * Role model (Domain Owner, Steward, Community Member, Data Consumer)
  * Privilege granularity: view, edit, certify, publish, admin
  * Least privilege principle and role inheritance
* **Authentication & Authorization**

  * SSO (SAML/OAuth/OIDC), LDAP/AD integration, MFA policy
  * Service accounts and secrets management best practices
* **Connector configuration**

  * Network setup (Edge Agent vs direct), credentials (vault integration), scheduling, filter scopes, incremental vs full ingestion
  * Proxy/Firewall, cert management, TLS configuration
* **Workflow settings**

  * Approval chains, escalation rules, SLA timers, retry logic, notifications (email/Slack)
* **Policy management**

  * Define and version policies (PII handling, retention, archiving)
  * Enforcement vs advisory policies and automated remediation workflows
* **Notifications & Alerting**

  * Notification templates, subscriptions, escalation matrices, incident response hooks
* **Audit, Logging & Monitoring**

  * Audit trails for config changes, who published what and when, run logs for connectors
  * Integration with SIEM/monitoring tools for alerts
* **Environment topology & lifecycle**

  * Dev / Test / Prod separation, config promotion mechanisms, backup & restore for config
  * High availability, disaster recovery considerations
* **Data protection**

  * Encryption at rest/in transit, key management, token lifecycle
* **Change control**

  * Approval gates for config changes, CAB processes, change rollback strategies

### Real-world configuration / 5-year experience points (what to explain)

* **Least privilege by default:** assign narrow roles and escalation groups; avoid broad admin accounts.
* **SSO + SCIM automation:** onboard and offboard users via HR-driven SCIM provisioning to avoid stale accounts.
* **Secrets management:** never store plaintext credentials in connector config — integrate with Vault/KMS.
* **Edge Agent configuration:** run agents in source VPCs to reduce network exposure; document required ports and certs.
* **Policy enforcement:** implement automated PII tagging with a policy that triggers a workflow when sensitive fields are found.
* **Change management:** use configuration as code (where possible), keep infra/config changes in source control, and automate promotions through CI/CD for governance artifacts.

### STAR Example 1 — RBAC & SSO for PII protection

**Situation:** Sensitive customer data needed stricter access control; manual user provisioning caused stale privileged accounts.
**Task:** Secure access and automate provisioning for compliance.
**Action:** Implemented SAML SSO with SCIM provisioning from IdP, created role matrix, removed direct admin accounts, integrated Collibra with Vault for connector credentials, and added audit logging for all cert actions.
**Result:** Reduced privileged account sprawl, improved auditability, and shortened user provisioning time from days to hours; auditors validated account lifecycle controls.

### STAR Example 2 — Connector & scheduling configuration

**Situation:** Onboarding new analytic sources required frequent manual reconfiguration and caused inconsistent scans.
**Task:** Standardize connector config and schedules across teams.
**Action:** Created connector templates in Marketplace with parameterized credentials and incremental scan settings, enforced via dev→prod promotion and set SLA alerts for failed runs. Integrated logs into monitoring so failures trigger Slack alerts.
**Result:** Onboarding time cut by ~60%, failed ingestion events responded to faster, and metadata freshness improved.

### Interview talking points (say these to sound like 5 yrs)

* “I treat Settings as product configuration — it’s the control plane; misconfig here exposes the whole catalog.”
* “Use SSO + SCIM to avoid orphaned accounts; tie RBAC to job functions not individuals.”
* “Integrate connector secrets with Vault; run Edge Agents in private subnets with least-access network rules.”
* “All change must go through dev → test → prod with a QA sign-off and audit trail; use automation where possible.”
* “Monitor connectors, workflows, and retention quotas with SLAs and alerts integrated into incident channels.”

### Common interview Qs + concise answers

* **Q: How do you prevent unauthorized certs or role escalations?**
  A: Enforce multi-step approvals, restrict 'certify' privilege to stewards, and log/alert all certification events.
* **Q: How do you secure connector credentials?**
  A: Use a secrets manager (Vault/KMS), ephemeral tokens when possible, and rotate credentials periodically.
* **Q: How to manage config promotion?**
  A: Keep config in source control or use Collibra's migration tools; promote from dev→qa→prod with automated tests and approvals.

### Best practices & pitfalls to call out

* **Best practices**

  * Principle of least privilege; RBAC matrices documented and enforced.
  * Automate provisioning (SSO/SCIM) and secret rotation.
  * Separate environments and require QA/approval to promote configuration.
  * Maintain audit logging and integrate with SIEM.
  * Use feature flags or phased rollout for big policy changes.
* **Pitfalls**

  * Hardcoding creds in connector configs.
  * Giving broad admin rights for convenience.
  * No dev/test verification before pushing config to production.
  * No monitoring for connector runs or workflows.

### KPIs & operational metrics to mention

* Time to provision a user (before vs after SCIM)
* # of privileged accounts / reductions in privileged accounts
* Connector success rate (%) and mean time to repair (MTTR)
* % of configuration changes with approved QA sign-off
* Time to onboard a source (days → hours)

# Quick cheat-phrases to drop in an interview (sound like a pro)

* “We treat Marketplace templates as policy-as-code for governance patterns.”
* “All connector credentials live in a secrets manager and Edge Agents run in the source VPC.”
* “SSO + SCIM for provisioning, RBAC for least privilege, and automated audits for compliance.”
* “Dev→Test→Prod promotion with QA, versioning, and audit logs — change control is mandatory.”

If you want, I’ll now:

* Create a **one-page printable cheat sheet** that lists the exact bullets to say in interviews (ready to memorize), or
* Draw a **visual diagram** (Domains → Marketplace templates → Settings: RBAC/SSO → Connectors/Edge → Workflows → Auditing) that you can use during an interview to explain flow.

### 🔄 **Workflow Lifecycle (How It Works in Real-time)**

1. **Trigger**

   * A user or system triggers workflow manually or automatically (e.g., when a dataset changes).
2. **Task Assignment**

   * Workflow assigns tasks to stewards, owners, or approvers.
3. **Review / Decision**

   * Approvers review metadata, lineage, or quality metrics.
4. **Action**

   * Workflow updates asset status (certified, rejected, deprecated).
5. **Audit & Notification**

   * Logs are captured; notifications sent to stakeholders.

### 🧠 **Types of Workflows You Can Talk About**

| Type                         | Description                                         | Example                                                   |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Certification Workflow**   | Automates dataset certification approval.           | Dataset → Reviewed → Certified.                           |
| **Data Quality Remediation** | Triggered when data fails quality rules.            | Null % > 10% → Steward notified → Fix initiated.          |
| **Access Request Workflow**  | Automates user access approvals for sensitive data. | User requests access → Steward approves → Access granted. |
| **Policy Review Workflow**   | Automates policy approval and periodic review.      | Policy drafted → Compliance Officer approves.             |
| **PII Tagging Workflow**     | Automatically starts when PII data is detected.     | Column tagged “PII” → Review & Confirm.                   |

---

### 🧰 **Integration & Automation**

Workflows often connect with:

* **Collibra Marketplace:** ready-made workflow templates (certification, stewardship onboarding, etc.)
* **Connectors / Edge:** workflows can trigger after ingestion or lineage sync
* **External Systems:** via REST APIs (ServiceNow, Jira, Snowflake, etc.)
* **Notifications:** Slack/Email integrations for approvals

---

### ✅ **Best Practices for Workflows (mention these in interviews)**

* **Start simple:** Build core workflows (certification, access, stewardship onboarding).
* **Reuse templates:** Use Marketplace templates, customize for your org.
* **Avoid over-automation:** Too many triggers = workflow floods.
* **Add SLA timers:** Escalate if no response within defined time.
* **Keep audit logs:** Ensure traceability for compliance (GDPR/SOX).
* **Test in lower environments:** Validate forms, triggers, and role assignments before production.

---

### ⚡ **Real-World STAR Examples**

#### **Example 1 — Dataset Certification Workflow**

**Situation:**
Teams certified datasets manually through Excel and emails — inconsistent and slow.

**Task:**
Automate dataset certification to ensure stewards follow a standardized review process.

**Action:**

* Designed BPMN workflow for certification.
* Configured triggers when a new dataset is registered.
* Workflow sent task to Steward → Data Owner → automatic status update (“Certified”).
* Deployed via Collibra Marketplace template with custom notifications.

**Result:**
Certification time reduced from **7 days to 2 days**, manual errors dropped, and audit logs improved compliance visibility.

---

#### **Example 2 — PII Access Approval Workflow**

**Situation:**
Users directly accessed sensitive datasets without approval.

**Task:**
Implement a workflow to control and log PII access requests.

**Action:**

* Built a workflow that triggers on “Access Request” form submission.
* Added approval chain: Steward → Data Owner → Compliance.
* Integrated with ServiceNow to update ticket automatically.
* Logged all approvals for audit.

**Result:**
Access became fully traceable, audit risk reduced, and compliance score improved by 40%.

---

#### **Example 3 — Data Quality Issue Remediation Workflow**

**Situation:**
Analysts frequently found nulls/duplicates but had no process to report or track fixes.

**Task:**
Implement workflow to manage data quality remediation.

**Action:**

* Created a “Data Issue” workflow triggered from Data Quality dashboard.
* Assigned issue to Data Steward, auto-escalated to Owner after 48 hrs.
* Status changed to “Resolved” once steward updated metrics.

**Result:**
Average resolution time dropped from **5 days to 1.5 days**, and data issue backlog reduced by 60%.

---

### 🧭 **Interview Talking Points**
