Perfect! Let’s go **deep dive into all advanced topics** like I explained earlier — **kid → pro style**, with examples, STAR interview context, and everything you need to sound like a 5-year pro.

# **Advanced Collibra Topics – Complete Explanation**

---

## **1️⃣ Domains**

**Kid Explanation:**

* Imagine the library has **different sections**:

  * Comics, Science, Fiction, Non-Fiction
* Each section has **books, librarians, and rules**.

**Pro Explanation:**

* Domains in Collibra = **logical groupings of assets, datasets, and glossary terms** by business area.
* Examples:

  * **Customer Domain** → All customer-related tables, dashboards, glossary terms
  * **Finance Domain** → Accounting datasets, reports, glossary terms
* Each domain has:

  * **Stewards & Owners** → responsible for governance
  * **Policies & Workflows** → approvals, certification rules
  * **Assets** → datasets, dashboards, reports

**Interview Example:**
*"In a retail project, we grouped all sales-related datasets under the Sales Domain. Stewards managed certification, lineage, and glossary mapping, which reduced duplicate datasets by 30% and improved discoverability."*

---

## **2️⃣ Assets**

**Kid Explanation:**

* Each book in the library = an **asset**.
* Assets can be books, maps, or magazines — anything tracked in the catalog.

**Pro Explanation:**

* Assets in Collibra = **any cataloged item**:

  * Datasets, tables, reports, dashboards, ETL jobs, glossary terms
* Each asset has:

  * **Metadata** → columns, types, owner, last updated
  * **Lineage** → source → transformation → target
  * **Certification** → trusted or deprecated
  * **Quality Score** → completeness, duplicates, consistency

**Interview Example:**
*"Each dataset in Snowflake was registered as an asset. Metadata, lineage, and glossary mapping were captured, and stewards certified high-quality assets, ensuring trusted data for analytics teams."*

---

## **3️⃣ Communities**

**Kid Explanation:**

* Communities = **clubs of kids or teachers who manage a library section**.
* Example: Comic book club manages the Comics section.

**Pro Explanation:**

* Communities in Collibra = **groups of users managing a domain or business area**.
* Responsibilities:

  * Review & approve assets
  * Certify datasets
  * Ensure compliance with policies
* Helps **collaboration and governance**.

**Interview Example:**
*"The Finance Community was responsible for all accounting datasets. Members reviewed metadata, certified assets, and ensured compliance with SOX regulations."*

---

## **4️⃣ Marketplace**

**Kid Explanation:**

* Marketplace = **library store**, where kids can **browse, request, or borrow books and tools**.

**Pro Explanation:**

* Collibra Marketplace = **central hub for assets, workflows, connectors, and templates**.
* Enables:

  * Reuse of workflows (certification, PII tagging)
  * Deployment of connectors for data ingestion
  * Quick access to templates and automated governance processes

**Interview Example:**
*"We used Collibra Marketplace to deploy prebuilt workflows for dataset certification and PII tagging, reducing manual effort by 50%."*

---

## **5️⃣ Settings & Configuration**

**Kid Explanation:**

* Library rules: opening hours, borrowing limits, librarian roles, security rules.

**Pro Explanation:**

* Collibra Settings = **system configuration for roles, permissions, connectors, workflows, notifications, and policies**.
* Key components:

  * **Roles & Permissions** → who can view, edit, approve, certify
  * **Connector Settings** → configure database/ETL/BI connections
  * **Workflow Settings** → notifications, approvals, escalation rules
  * **Policy Management** → compliance & PII access rules

**Interview Example:**
*"Configured Collibra roles, communities, and workflows to ensure only stewards could certify datasets and approve PII access, enforcing security and compliance."*

---

## **6️⃣ Workflows**

**Kid Explanation:**

* Librarian workflow = check book → fix label → approve gold star.

**Pro Explanation:**

* Collibra Workflows = **automated processes for governance tasks**.
* Examples of workflows:

  * Dataset certification
  * Data quality remediation
  * Access requests for PII datasets
  * Policy approvals
* Can be **manual or automatic**.
* Linked to **Marketplace for deployment and reuse**.

**Interview Example:**
*"Implemented a certification workflow: stewards receive a notification → review metadata, lineage, and quality → approve certification → asset status updated automatically. This reduced manual errors and ensured consistency."*
