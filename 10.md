## 🧭 **8️⃣ Collibra Search & Discovery — In-Depth (for 5 Years Experienced Data Steward / Engineer)**

### 🔹 What It Is

Search & Discovery in Collibra helps users **find, explore, and understand** data assets across the enterprise.
It’s like Google for your data catalog — but with governance and trust built in.

---

### 🔹 Why It Matters

In large enterprises, there are **thousands of datasets, reports, and glossary terms**.
Without a robust discovery layer:

* Data scientists waste hours finding the right data.
* Business users reuse outdated or uncertified datasets.
* Governance teams struggle with trust and lineage traceability.

Search & Discovery **solves all that** by surfacing the *right* data at the *right* time with full context and quality indicators.

### 🔹 Key Features

| Feature                          | Description                                                                                  | Real-time Example                                                                |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Global Search Bar**            | Search across all domains — assets, glossary, reports, workflows                             | A user types “Customer” → sees glossary term, Snowflake table, Tableau dashboard |
| **Advanced Filters / Facets**    | Filter results by domain, certification status, tags, PII flag, community, or steward        | Filter for *Certified datasets* tagged as *Finance*                              |
| **Faceted Navigation**           | Navigate step-by-step to narrow down from broad search → exact asset                         | From “Sales” → “Reports” → “Certified”                                           |
| **Smart Recommendations**        | Suggests related datasets, similar terms, or connected reports based on metadata and lineage | Searching “Revenue” suggests “Profit Margin Dashboard”                           |
| **Asset Preview Panel**          | Quick summary of asset type, description, steward, and certification                         | Users can decide if it’s relevant without opening full details                   |
| **Natural Language Search (AI)** | Collibra 2024+ versions support semantic search — “Show me certified customer tables”        | Returns relevant datasets even if wording differs                                |

# 🏷️ **9️⃣ Collibra Tagging & Classification — Complete 5-Year Expert Breakdown**

---

### 🧒 **Kid Explanation (Quick Recap)**

In the library:

* You put **stickers on books** — red for secret, blue for science, green for popular.
* It helps everyone find and manage books quickly.
  Same idea in Collibra — stickers = **tags**, and categories = **classifications**.

---

## 🧠 **Pro Explanation (Detailed)**

### 🔹 What It Is

**Tagging & Classification** in Collibra helps you:

* Label datasets, reports, and glossary terms
* Categorize assets for **search, discovery, and governance**
* Flag sensitive data for **security and compliance**

---

### 🔹 Types of Tagging

| Tag Type                  | Description                               | Example                                |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Business Tags**         | Describe *what area* the data belongs to  | “Finance”, “Customer”, “Marketing”     |
| **Data Sensitivity Tags** | Mark assets as sensitive or regulated     | “PII”, “Confidential”, “GDPR”, “HIPAA” |
| **Technical Tags**        | Describe system or source characteristics | “Snowflake”, “Tableau”, “Informatica”  |
| **Quality Tags**          | Represent data trust or condition         | “Certified”, “Deprecated”, “In Review” |

---

### 🔹 Classification vs Tagging

| Concept            | Meaning                                        | Example                                   |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Classification** | Hierarchical grouping (taxonomy-based)         | `Data → Sensitive → Personal → Financial` |
| **Tagging**        | Simple label applied manually or automatically | Tag: “Finance”, “PII”, “Sales”            |

💡 **Tip:**
Use **classification** for *structured, hierarchical data types* (like sensitivity levels),
and **tags** for *freeform, quick grouping* (like projects or teams).

---

### 🔹 Automation of Tagging

Collibra allows both **manual and automated** tagging:

1. **Manual Tagging:**

   * Done by stewards during data certification or import.
   * Example: Steward tags a column “Email_ID” as `PII`.

2. **Automated Tagging (via Scanner or DQ tool):**

   * Collibra Data Quality or external scanners (Informatica DQ, BigID, Alation, etc.) identify patterns.
   * Automatically tag fields like SSN, Credit Card, PAN, etc.
   * Integrated with Collibra via REST API or Connector.

🧩 Example:

> The DQ scanner identifies a column “Customer_Email” → marks it as PII → pushes tag “Sensitive: PII” into Collibra.

---

### 🔹 Governance & Compliance Impact

| Benefit                  | Description                                                       |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Compliance Reporting** | Easily filter all “PII” tagged assets for GDPR or HIPAA reporting |
| **Access Control**       | Restrict access to sensitive assets based on tags                 |
| **Data Discovery**       | Users can search “Finance + Certified” to find safe-to-use data   |
| **Audit Readiness**      | Regulators can view how sensitive data is tracked and protected   |

---

### 🔹 Real-time Implementation Example

> In our enterprise data catalog, we classified all datasets by **sensitivity (Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted)** and tagged PII elements using automated scanners.
> Tags like “Finance”, “Customer”, and “PII” improved search and lineage tracing.
> During a GDPR audit, we generated a report of all “PII” assets and their stewards — saving **weeks of manual effort**.

---

### 💬 **Interview Answer (STAR Format)**

**Situation:** The organization needed to identify and manage sensitive data (PII) across multiple systems for GDPR compliance.
**Task:** Build a centralized tagging and classification system within Collibra.
**Action:** Integrated Collibra with a data scanner to auto-detect and tag sensitive fields (emails, SSNs, PANs). Created classification hierarchy for sensitivity and added business tags for ownership.
**Result:** Achieved 100% visibility of sensitive data assets and reduced compliance reporting time by 70%.

---

### 💡 **Pro Interview Tips**

✅ Highlight **automation** (tagging via scanners or APIs)
✅ Mention **classification hierarchy** for sensitivity
✅ Stress **impact on compliance & discoverability**
✅ If asked about governance impact, say:

> “We implemented sensitivity classification across domains, which allowed our compliance team to filter and review only PII-tagged assets, reducing audit effort drastically.”

# 9️⃣ Tagging & Classification — deep dive (5-year pro)

---

## 🧸 Kid version (one-liner)

Put colored stickers on books so everyone knows what they are — red for secret, blue for science, green for popular.

---

## 🏢 Pro version (definition)

**Tagging** = applying labels (freeform or controlled) to assets (tables, columns, dashboards, glossary terms).
**Classification** = placing assets into a structured taxonomy/hierarchy (e.g., Sensitivity → Public / Internal / Confidential / Restricted).
Together they make assets discoverable, enforceable (access / masking rules), and auditable.

---

## ✅ Business uses & examples

* **PII / Sensitive tagging:** SSN, PAN, Email → drives masking, access approvals, audits.
* **Business categorization:** Finance, Sales, HR → helps business users find domain assets.
* **Technical tags:** Source=Snowflake, Format=Parquet → for ops/ingestion logic.
* **Quality & trust:** Certified, Deprecated, In Review → guides users to trusted data.
* **Retention / legal:** Retention=7Y, LegalHold → triggers archival or legal workflows.

---

## 🔧 Tag types & structures

* **Freeform tags:** Quick labels (project names, temporary markers).
* **Controlled tags / taxonomy:** Predefined categories (must use approved values).
* **Attributes/Facets:** Tags with metadata (tag confidence, createdBy, createdOn).
* **Classifications (hierarchies):** e.g., `Sensitivity → Personal → Financial`.

---

## ⚙️ How tagging is implemented (practical steps)

1. **Design taxonomy:** define classifications (sensitivity levels, business domains) and naming conventions.
2. **Create tag governance:** owners for each tag, approval workflow for new tags.
3. **Automated discovery:** run scanners/DLP or rules to auto-detect patterns and suggest tags.
4. **Manual verification:** stewards review auto-tags (reduce false positives).
5. **Apply & enforce:** tag metadata stored in Collibra; tag-driven policies (RBAC, masking) enforced via downstream systems.
6. **Monitor & report:** dashboards show tag coverage, changes, and audit logs.
7. **Lifecycle:** retire or version tags as business needs change.

---

## 🤖 Automation & detection approaches

* **Pattern / rule-based:** regex or dictionary lookups (good for emails, SSNs).

  * Example regexes (customize and test before use):

    * Email: `\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}\b`
    * US SSN (simple): `\b\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}\b`
    * Indian PAN: `\b[A-Z]{5}\d{4}[A-Z]\b`
  * *Caution:* tune to minimize false positives/negatives.
* **Machine learning / pattern models:** classifiers that learn from examples (better for free-text PII or complex fields).
* **Data Profiling / DQ tools:** detect distributions, outliers, sensitive patterns.
* **External DLP / discovery tools:** BigID, Varonis, Google DLP → push tags into Collibra via connectors/APIs.
* **Event-driven tagging:** tag on ingest (Edge Agent or ETL step) for near-real-time classification.

---

## 🔗 Tag → Policy → Enforcement (how tagging becomes enforcement)

1. Tag asset as `PII:High`.
2. Collibra triggers a **policy workflow** (notify steward, require approval to publish).
3. Tag maps to **access control**: BI tool masks column or blocks export for non-authorized roles.
4. Tag appears in **compliance reports** and audit trails.

Example rule:

* If `asset.tags contains 'PII'` → create access request workflow before granting read access.

---

## 🛡️ Governance around tags

* **Tag owners & stewards:** responsible for correctness and lifecycle.
* **Approval workflows:** for new tags or mass reclassification.
* **Versioning & provenance:** store who applied/changed a tag and why.
* **Confidence scoring:** auto-tag confidence (auto=0.6) requires steward approval above/below thresholds.
* **Tag hygiene:** periodic reviews to remove unused or ambiguous tags.

---

## 📈 Metrics & KPIs to track

* % of assets tagged (overall / by domain)
* % of PII assets inventoried (coverage)
* Auto-tag accuracy (precision / recall) after verification
* Time to remediate unclassified assets
* # of policy enforcement events triggered by tags
* Audit findings related to tagging (before vs after improvements)

---

## 💡 Best practices (say these in interviews)

* **Start with a minimal, controlled taxonomy** and expand iteratively.
* **Automate detection** but require steward verification for high-risk tags.
* **Name tags consistently** (e.g., `sensitivity:restricted`, `business:finance`).
* **Map tags to actions** (masking, access controls, retention) — taxonomy without action is useless.
* **Keep provenance & audit logs** for every tag change.
* **Educate users**: documentation and quick guides on what tags mean and who owns them.

---

## 🚫 Common pitfalls (and how to avoid)

* **Too many freeform tags → chaos.** Use controlled lists.
* **Blind automation → lots of false positives.** Add confidence thresholds and reviews.
* **No owner for tags → stale taxonomy.** Assign owners when creating tags.
* **Not linking tags to enforcement → tags become decorative.** Tie tags to policies and downstream enforcement.

## 🧾 STAR Interview Example (PII classification)

**Situation:** GDPR audit required a full inventory of PII across multiple systems (Snowflake, S3, Tableau).
**Task:** Identify, tag, and report all PII assets for audit and remediation.
**Action:** Deployed automated scanners to detect PII patterns, funneled results into Collibra, set confidence threshold (≥0.8 auto-tag), required steward review for 0.5–0.8. Mapped `PII` tag to an access-request workflow and masking policy in BI. Built a PII dashboard for compliance team.
**Result:** Achieved >95% PII coverage across key systems, reduced manual discovery effort by weeks, and passed the GDPR review with minimal findings.

---

## 🗣️ What to say in an interview (quick bullets)

* “We defined a controlled taxonomy (sensitivity, business domain, technical source) and enforced it via approval workflows.”
* “We automated tag discovery using DLP and regex for deterministic fields, backed by steward verification for high-risk tags.”
* “Tags are actionable — they map to masking, RBAC, and retention policies; Collibra stores tag provenance for audit.”
* “We tracked tag coverage and auto-tag accuracy as KPIs and performed quarterly tag-hygiene reviews.”
