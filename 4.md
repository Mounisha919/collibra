# 🧸 Topic 9: Compliance & PII (Kid Story)

Imagine the library again 📚:

* Some books have **secret pages** (like diary entries or top-secret info).
* Not every kid can read them. Only **authorized kids or teachers** can see.

In data terms:

* **PII** = Secret info about people, like:

  * Name, Email, Phone, SSN, PAN
* **Compliance rules** = Library rules for who can access secrets

Collibra helps by:

* Tagging datasets that contain PII
* Restricting access to authorized users
* Tracking where sensitive data moves

**Kid takeaway:** Only safe kids read secret pages; rules are followed strictly.

### 3️⃣ Example for Interviews

*"In a banking project, we tagged all columns containing PII such as SSN, Email, and PAN. Collibra applied access policies so only authorized stewards and analysts could view sensitive data. Lineage tracking ensured we could trace PII from source Oracle tables through ETL to Snowflake and Tableau dashboards. This simplified GDPR compliance and reduced audit effort by 40%."*
