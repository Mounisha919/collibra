# 🧸 Topic 1: What is Data Governance (Kid Story)

Imagine you’re in a **huge library** 📚.

* Thousands of books (data).
* Some books are new, some old, some restricted, some missing.
* Everyone wants to read but nobody knows which book is correct, who owns it, or if it’s allowed.

The **library rules & people** who ensure:

* Books are labelled properly,
* Borrowers follow rules,
* Librarians know where each book came from,
* Some books are marked “trusted”,
* Secret books are locked,

= **Data Governance** ✅

It’s not about the books themselves — it’s about:

* **Rules** (how data should be managed),
* **People** (owners, stewards),
* **Processes** (approvals, certifications),
* **Technology** (like Collibra) to enforce all this.

---

# 🏢 Topic 1: Data Governance (Pro Answer)

“Data governance is the framework of **people, processes, and technology** that ensures data is accurate, secure, understood, and used properly across the organization.
It covers:

* **Ownership**: who is responsible for data.
* **Policies**: how data can be used.
* **Quality**: is the data correct and up to date.
* **Compliance**: are we following regulations like GDPR.
* **Cataloging**: making data discoverable and understandable.

Collibra is a tool that operationalizes data governance — it helps organizations implement these practices.”

Perfect! Let’s dive **deeper into Data Catalog** so you really **understand it like a pro**, but still in **kid-friendly first + pro terms**. I’ll break it into **components, workflows, and practical usage**.

# 🧸 Data Catalog — Full Kid-Friendly Story

Imagine the library again 📚, but now let’s explore **every corner**:

1. **Bookshelves = Systems**

   * Oracle, Snowflake, Tableau dashboards, Excel sheets → each shelf holds books (datasets).

2. **Books = Datasets**

   * Each book has chapters (tables) and pages (columns).

3. **Labels on books = Metadata**

   * Shows title, author, number of pages, genre, last updated date.
   * Helps kids know what the book is about without opening it.

4. **Library map = Lineage**

   * Arrows showing how books moved: publisher → truck → library → reading desk.
   * In Collibra, this shows where the data came from, how it was transformed, and where it’s used.

5. **Stickers = Business Glossary mapping**

   * Attach “Customer” or “Order” sticker to the right books so all kids understand the meaning.

6. **Gold star = Certification**

   * Only trusted books get a gold star.
   * Duplicate or outdated books are marked “deprecated” so no one reads them by mistake.

7. **Red stickers = PII / sensitive data**

   * Secret pages (SSN, PAN, email) are flagged so only teachers (authorized users) can see them.

8. **Library librarian = Steward**

   * Checks books, certifies them, updates labels, and handles requests.

9. **Daily check = Scheduled scans**

   * Every day, new books or updates are automatically added to the map so the catalog is always fresh.

# 🏢 Data Catalog — Professional Explanation (Detailed)

**Collibra Data Catalog** is more than just a list of datasets. It’s a **centralized, governed metadata repository** that helps organizations **discover, trust, and understand** data.

### 1️⃣ Key Components

* **Assets:** Tables, columns, views, reports, dashboards.
* **Metadata:** Technical info like column types, row counts, last updated timestamps.
* **Business Glossary Mapping:** Links technical assets to business terms (common definitions).
* **Lineage:** Captures source → transformation → target flow for traceability.
* **Stewardship & Certification:** Owners/stewards approve datasets; certified datasets = trusted.
* **Data Quality:** Stores profiling info (null %, duplicates, completeness).
* **Compliance:** Supports tagging of PII, GDPR, HIPAA, and other sensitive info.

### 2️⃣ Workflows / How it Works

1. **Ingestion / Harvest:** Pull metadata from systems (DBs, ETL, BI tools).
2. **Mapping:** Link datasets to business glossary terms.
3. **Lineage capture:** Automatic via ETL connectors or manual via API.
4. **Stewardship:** Assign owners for review & certification.
5. **Certification:** Mark trusted datasets; deprecate duplicates.
6. **Ongoing refresh:** Schedule incremental scans to keep catalog up-to-date.

### 3️⃣ Benefits

* **Discoverability:** Users find the right data quickly.
* **Trust:** Certified datasets reduce errors.
* **Governance:** Ensures ownership, policies, and compliance.
* **Efficiency:** Reduces duplicate datasets and repeated queries.

---

💡 **Interview Talking Points**

* You can explain **technical vs business metadata**.
* Mention **lineage for traceability**.
* Show understanding of **certification workflow**.
* Emphasize **PII tagging and compliance support**.
* Give a mini example:
  *“In our project, we cataloged Snowflake and Tableau assets. Linked tables to the business term ‘Customer’, certified 50 datasets, deprecated 10 duplicates, and tracked lineage to ensure traceability for GDPR audits.”*

If you want, next I can take you to **Topic 3: Metadata** — where we will learn **what metadata really is, its types, examples, and why it’s important** — in the same **kid + pro detailed style**.

Do you want to move to **Metadata** next?
Great! Let’s move to **Topic 3: Metadata**. I’ll explain it **like a kid first**, then in **pro detail**, with examples and interview context.

# 🧸 Topic 3: Metadata (Kid Story)

Imagine the library again 📚:

* Each **book** has a **cover, title, author, number of pages, genre**, and maybe a **last-read date**.
* You don’t open every book to know about it — you **look at the labels**.

All those labels and information about the book are called **metadata** — **data about data**.

For example:

* Book Name = Table Name
* Chapters = Columns
* Number of Pages = Row Count
* Author = Data Owner
* Last Updated = When data was last changed

So metadata **tells you everything you need to know about the dataset without touching the data itself**.

---

# 🏢 Topic 3: Metadata (Pro Explanation)

**Metadata** is **information that describes and gives context to data**. It’s the backbone of data catalogs like Collibra.

### 1️⃣ Types of Metadata

1. **Technical Metadata**

   * Details about the structure of data.
   * Example: Table name, column names, data types, nullability, row count, size.

2. **Business Metadata**

   * Explains **what the data means for business users**.
   * Example: Column “Cust_ID” = “Customer ID”, glossary term “Customer”, description: “Unique ID assigned to each customer”.

3. **Operational Metadata**

   * Information about **how data is processed and used**.
   * Example: Last updated timestamp, ETL job name, source system, refresh frequency.

4. **Lineage Metadata**

   * Shows **where the data came from and how it moved**.
   * Example: Oracle table → ETL job → Snowflake → Tableau dashboard.

---

### 2️⃣ Why Metadata is Important

* **Discoverability:** Users can search datasets by name, owner, or description.
* **Trust & Certification:** Metadata helps identify high-quality datasets.
* **Compliance:** Metadata shows where sensitive data exists (PII, GDPR).
* **Lineage & Impact Analysis:** Know what downstream dashboards or reports use the data.

---

### 3️⃣ How Metadata Works in Collibra

1. **Ingestion:** Collibra connectors pull metadata from sources like Oracle, Snowflake, Tableau.
2. **Mapping:** Technical metadata is linked to business terms in the glossary.
3. **Enrichment:** Add descriptions, tags, PII labels, and quality metrics.
4. **Certification & Stewardship:** Metadata helps stewards decide which datasets are trustworthy.

**Example for Interviews:**
*"We ingested Oracle and Snowflake tables into Collibra. Each table’s columns were linked to business glossary terms. Technical metadata (column types, row counts) and operational metadata (last ETL run, source system) were captured. This helped our analysts quickly find trusted datasets and reduced duplicate reporting errors by 30%."*

💡 **Kid → Pro Shortcut for Interviews:**

* Kid: “Labels on books tell you about the book.”
* Pro: “Metadata is data about data; it includes technical, business, operational, and lineage info, enabling discoverability, trust, and compliance.”

When you say **“I understand”**, we’ll move to **Topic 4: Business Glossary**, which builds on metadata and is key for explaining Collibra like a pro.
