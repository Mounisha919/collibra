# 🧸 Topic 1: What is Data Governance (Kid Story)

Imagine you’re in a **huge library** 📚.

* Thousands of books (data).
* Some books are new, some old, some restricted, some missing.
* Everyone wants to read but nobody knows which book is correct, who owns it, or if it’s allowed.

The **library rules & people** who ensure:

* Books are labelled properly,
* Borrowers follow rules,
* Librarians know where each book came from,
* Some books are marked “trusted”,
* Secret books are locked,

= **Data Governance** ✅

It’s not about the books themselves — it’s about:

* **Rules** (how data should be managed),
* **People** (owners, stewards),
* **Processes** (approvals, certifications),
* **Technology** (like Collibra) to enforce all this.

---

# 🏢 Topic 1: Data Governance (Pro Answer)

# **🏢 Topic 1: Data Governance (Deep-Dive)**

### **1️⃣ What is Data Governance?**

**Pro Answer:**
Data Governance (DG) is the **framework of people, processes, and technology** that ensures data across an organization is:

* **Accurate & trustworthy** (quality)
* **Secure & compliant** (privacy & regulations)
* **Understandable & discoverable** (cataloging & metadata)
* **Used responsibly** (policies & controls)

**Key idea:** DG isn’t just about data—it’s about **managing the data lifecycle end-to-end**, assigning responsibilities, enforcing policies, and providing tools for monitoring and compliance.

---

### **2️⃣ Core Components of Data Governance**

1. **People (Roles & Responsibilities)**
   *Defines who manages, approves, and uses data.*

   * **Data Owner:** Accountable for data in a domain (e.g., Customer domain owns “Customer Name” column).
   * **Data Steward:** Maintains data quality, ensures policies are applied, resolves issues.
   * **Data Custodian/Technical Steward:** Manages the technical storage, security, and infrastructure.
   * **Data Consumer:** Uses data responsibly for analytics or operations.

   **Interview Tip:**

   * Q: “What’s the difference between a data steward and data custodian?”
   * A: Stewards focus on **quality, policies, and usage**; Custodians focus on **technical infrastructure, storage, and access control**.

---

2. **Processes (Policies, Standards, & Workflows)**

   * **Data Policies:** Rules defining **how data can be created, stored, shared, and retired**. Example: PII data must be encrypted and access-limited.
   * **Data Quality Rules:** Define acceptable thresholds (completeness, accuracy, uniqueness).
   * **Workflow Automation:** Approvals, certifications, and issue resolution.

   **Example:**

   * PII approval workflow → Data steward validates masking and compliance before data access is granted.

   **Interview Tip:**

   * Q: “How do you operationalize data governance policies?”
   * A: Implement **automated workflows in Collibra**, integrate with **ETL or BI tools**, and monitor compliance.

---

3. **Technology (Tools & Platforms)**

   * Tools like **Collibra, Informatica, Alation** help implement governance at scale.
   * Features:

     * **Data Catalog:** Metadata management, discovery, lineage visualization.
     * **Business Glossary:** Standard definitions, linked to technical assets.
     * **Workflows & Marketplace:** Automate approvals, certifications, and quality remediation.
     * **Security & Compliance:** Role-based access, auditing, and GDPR/HIPAA reporting.

   **Interview Tip:**

   * Q: “Why use a tool like Collibra instead of Excel sheets for governance?”
   * A: Collibra enables **scalability, automation, lineage tracking, and compliance auditing**—manual Excel processes are error-prone and non-scalable.

# 🧸 Data Catalog — Full Kid-Friendly Story

Imagine the library again 📚, but now let’s explore **every corner**:

1. **Bookshelves = Systems**

   * Oracle, Snowflake, Tableau dashboards, Excel sheets → each shelf holds books (datasets).

2. **Books = Datasets**

   * Each book has chapters (tables) and pages (columns).

3. **Labels on books = Metadata**

   * Shows title, author, number of pages, genre, last updated date.
   * Helps kids know what the book is about without opening it.

4. **Library map = Lineage**

   * Arrows showing how books moved: publisher → truck → library → reading desk.
   * In Collibra, this shows where the data came from, how it was transformed, and where it’s used.

5. **Stickers = Business Glossary mapping**

   * Attach “Customer” or “Order” sticker to the right books so all kids understand the meaning.

6. **Gold star = Certification**

   * Only trusted books get a gold star.
   * Duplicate or outdated books are marked “deprecated” so no one reads them by mistake.

7. **Red stickers = PII / sensitive data**

   * Secret pages (SSN, PAN, email) are flagged so only teachers (authorized users) can see them.

8. **Library librarian = Steward**

   * Checks books, certifies them, updates labels, and handles requests.

9. **Daily check = Scheduled scans**

   * Every day, new books or updates are automatically added to the map so the catalog is always fresh.

# 🧸 Topic 3: Metadata (Kid Story)

Imagine the library again 📚:

* Each **book** has a **cover, title, author, number of pages, genre**, and maybe a **last-read date**.
* You don’t open every book to know about it — you **look at the labels**.

All those labels and information about the book are called **metadata** — **data about data**.

For example:

* Book Name = Table Name
* Chapters = Columns
* Number of Pages = Row Count
* Author = Data Owner
* Last Updated = When data was last changed

So metadata **tells you everything you need to know about the dataset without touching the data itself**.

---
Perfect 👏 You’ve now got a **solid foundation** on **Topic 3: Metadata** — but since you said you want *in-depth knowledge so interviewers can’t catch you off guard*, let’s go one step **beyond** what you wrote — into **deep professional insights**, **real-world usage in Collibra**, and **interview-level questions + STAR answers** 💪

---

# 🧠 **Metadata — Deep Professional Explanation**

### 🔹 What is Metadata (in depth)

Metadata is **structured information that describes, explains, locates, or helps manage data assets** — in other words, it gives *context* and *meaning* to data.

Without metadata, data is like a **spreadsheet with numbers but no column headers** — you don’t know what anything means.

So, **metadata = context + description + traceability**.

In Collibra, metadata powers:

* **Data discovery** (search by keywords, owner, tag)
* **Lineage** (track movement)
* **Data quality dashboards**
* **Compliance** (find where PII lives)
* **Glossary mapping** (business meaning)

---

## 🧩 **Types of Metadata — Deep Dive with Real-time Examples**

| **Type**                 | **Purpose**                                   | **Examples**                                                                | **Where It Comes From**                     |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Technical Metadata**   | Describes structure and schema                | Table name, column name, data type, row count, primary key, constraints     | Database schema, ETL jobs, BI tool metadata |
| **Business Metadata**    | Gives meaning and business context            | “Cust_ID = Customer Identifier”; “Revenue = total sales amount”             | Business Glossary, SME input                |
| **Operational Metadata** | Describes data’s lifecycle and performance    | ETL job name, last refresh date, data owner, pipeline run time, data source | ETL tools (Informatica, Talend, Airflow)    |
| **Process Metadata**     | Describes how data moves and transforms       | “Aggregated daily”, “joins from table A + B”                                | ETL logs, transformation rules              |
| **Lineage Metadata**     | Shows where data originated and where it goes | Source: Oracle → ETL → Snowflake → Power BI                                 | Collibra Lineage, ETL connectors            |
| **Social Metadata**      | Captures collaboration and usage              | Comments, ratings, tags, steward notes                                      | Collibra community, user activity           |

## ⚙️ **How Metadata is Collected and Managed in Collibra**

### Step 1️⃣: **Harvesting (Metadata Extraction)**

* Collibra uses **Data Catalog connectors** (for Snowflake, Oracle, Tableau, Power BI, etc.) to *harvest* metadata automatically.
* This metadata includes table names, columns, types, owners, last refresh, etc.

### Step 2️⃣: **Storage (Metadata Repository)**

* All harvested metadata is stored in the **Collibra Data Governance Center (DGC)** repository.
* Each data element becomes an **asset** in Collibra (like “Table”, “Column”, “Report”, etc.).

### Step 3️⃣: **Enrichment (Metadata Enhancement)**

* Stewards add missing descriptions, tags, data sensitivity levels (PII, Non-PII), and glossary mappings.
* You can link datasets to policies or standards (like GDPR Article 5).

### Step 4️⃣: **Lineage Building**

* Lineage metadata connects data movement between systems.
  Example:
  Oracle → ETL → Snowflake → Tableau
  Helps perform *impact analysis* when changes occur.

### Step 5️⃣: **Certification & Stewardship**

* Metadata enables stewards to certify trusted datasets and mark deprecated ones.
* Certified metadata = higher confidence for business users.

## 💼 **Real-Time Example: Collibra Metadata Implementation**

> **Scenario:** Your company wants to catalog all Snowflake tables and Tableau reports for the Finance domain.

**Steps:**

1. Connect Collibra to **Snowflake** using the Collibra Data Catalog Connector.
2. Harvest **technical metadata**: schema, tables, columns, data types.
3. Add **business metadata**: definitions, glossary links (“Revenue”, “Expense”, “Profit”).
4. Capture **operational metadata**: last refreshed date, ETL job, owner.
5. Build **lineage** from Oracle → ETL → Snowflake → Tableau.
6. Assign stewards for review and **certify** trusted tables.

**Outcome:**
✅ Finance analysts can find and trust certified data.
✅ Auditors can trace where each revenue figure came from.
✅ PII data is tagged and monitored for GDPR compliance.

## 🧠 **Common Interview Questions on Metadata**

| **Question**                                                   | **Perfect 5-Year-Pro Answer**                                                                                                             |

| What is metadata?                                              | Metadata is data about data — it gives context and meaning to raw data, enabling discovery, governance, and compliance.                   |
| What are the types of metadata?                                | Technical, Business, Operational, Lineage, and Social. Each supports discoverability, traceability, and governance.                       |
| How does Collibra use metadata?                                | Collibra harvests metadata from data sources, enriches it with glossary terms, and connects it via lineage for traceability.              |
| What’s the difference between technical and business metadata? | Technical metadata is system-generated (column names, data types); business metadata adds meaning (customer = end user buying a product). |
| What’s lineage metadata?                                       | It traces data movement across systems, showing where data came from, how it was transformed, and where it’s used — crucial for audits.   |
| How does metadata improve compliance?                          | It helps locate sensitive data (PII) and track how it flows through systems, simplifying GDPR/HIPAA reporting.                            |
