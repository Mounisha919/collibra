# **11️⃣ Collibra: Domains vs Communities vs Roles**

**Kid Explanation:**

* **Domains** → Library sections (Fiction, Science)
* **Communities** → Clubs of kids/teachers managing each section
* **Roles** → Job titles of each librarian (Owner, Steward, Reader)

**Pro Explanation:**

* **Domains:** Logical grouping of assets and glossary by business area

  * Example: Customer Domain, Finance Domain
* **Communities:** Groups of users working on a domain

  * Responsible for certification, approvals, governance
* **Roles:** Define **permissions and responsibilities** for users

  * Examples: Steward, Owner, Contributor, Viewer
* Helps manage **who can do what, where, and on which assets**

**Real-time / Interview Tip:**

* Interviewers may ask:

  * “Explain the difference between Domains and Communities.”
  * “How do Roles enforce governance?”
* Strong Answer:
  *"Domains organize assets by business area. Communities are groups managing those domains. Roles define permissions: Owners approve, Stewards manage, Viewers can only see. This ensures proper governance and accountability."*

Awesome! 🎉

# **13️⃣ Collibra Certification & Approval Workflows**

**Kid Explanation:**

* Imagine each book needs a **gold star approval** before kids can read it:

  1. Librarian checks the book

* Interviewers may ask:

  * “Explain how you certify datasets in Collibra.”
